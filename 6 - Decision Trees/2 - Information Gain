Information Gain, is a matrix used to train a DT.
Constructing a DT is all about finding attributes that returns the highest information gain.
Info gain = Entropy(Parent) - Weighted Entropy(Children)
Hence, the working of a DT is to find a feature with maximum information gain and split it unless all the values are split, and then moving to the next feature.
